# Liking Lifecycles in React

In todays exercise we are going to practice lifecycles for a functional and class component. 
## Step 01 - Create a like toggle button
✨ Requirements ✨
 * When you click the button the class should toggle from 'default' to 'active
 * So if a button is 'default' and is clicked it should now have an 'active' className and vice versa


## Step 02 - Refactor into a like count

✨ Requirements ✨
 * The like count displays the number of likes each student / teacher has.
 * The starting like count should be a random number and is set when the component first mounts.
 * When the button is clicked the like count should go up. The count should be set and stored in state.
 * When clicked the button should have a class of "active" that after 500ms will be reset to "default"


## Step 03 - Refactor with all the same requirements into a functional component.
* Meet all the same requirements as step 02 but now using a functional component.
